Web Page Intro
=======================================================
This is intended to introduce you to the very basic development of a web page.

## Part 1:
Creation of the HTML doctype and header.  Your welcome to change the "This is document title" text...

Open the file in a web browser of your choice: Chrome, Edge, IE, Firefox, etc...  If using a windows machine you can able to drag and drop the file onto the browser top open it.  Each part should be tested by reloading the page (if you are not renaming the file or open the new file).

## Part 2:
Adding some actual information.  Try adding another header or several...  

Each step of the following steps will continue to build the page.

## Part 3:
Adding images.

## Part 4: 
Linking to another page.  Before the link will work, you need to create another page.  Create or save the current file with a different name.  In this sample we used **mybio.htm**.
